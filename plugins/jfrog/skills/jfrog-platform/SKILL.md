# JFrog Platform Skill

Workflow orchestration and domain knowledge for JFrog Platform MCP tools. Teaches *when and how to chain tools together* — tool schemas are provided by the MCP server itself.

## Platform Context

Cloud-hosted MCP Server (JFrog Cloud/SaaS only). URL: `https://<team>.jfrog.io`. Auth via OAuth — no API keys needed.

## Core Concepts

### Catalog vs. Artifactory

| | JFrog Catalog | Artifactory |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | Global OSS intelligence (12M+ packages) | Your org's private binary repos |
| **Answers** | "What's known about this package?" | "What do *we* use?" |
| **Tools** | Catalog tools | Tools with `rt_package` in name |

**Query routing:**
- "Is X safe?" / "Vulnerabilities in X?" → Catalog (public intel)
- "Do we use X?" / "Versions in our repos?" → Artifactory (internal)
- "Are we exposed to CVE-X?" → Both: Catalog for vuln data, Artifactory for exposure
- Ambiguous ("check log4j") → full security assessment workflow

Artifactory package tools are for dependency analysis only, NOT CI/CD build artifacts.

### Curation

Gatekeeper between public registries and your Artifactory. Status values:
- **approved** — safe to use
- **blocked** — rejected by policy; advise against use
- **inconclusive** — not yet evaluated; do NOT treat as approved

### Licenses

Always surface license type. Flag copyleft (GPL/AGPL) and unknown/missing licenses as risks.

### Repository Types

- **local** — internal packages | **remote** — proxied public repos | **virtual** — aggregation layer | **federated** — multi-site mirrors

**Virtual repo constraint:** The default deployment repo MUST be in the `repositories` list before setting it as default.

## Workflows

### 1: Package Security Assessment

**Trigger:** "is X safe?", "check package X", "should we use X?"

Chain sequentially:
1. **Catalog metadata** — malicious flag? license type? If malicious, STOP and warn.
2. **Vulnerabilities** — severity breakdown for the target version (default: latest)
3. **Curation status** — approved/blocked/inconclusive
4. **Internal usage** — Artifactory query for versions and repos
5. **Synthesize** — risk summary: malicious status, license, vuln counts, curation decision, internal exposure

### 2: Vulnerability Investigation

**Trigger:** "what is CVE-X?", "are we affected by CVE-X?"

1. **CVE lookup** in Catalog — affected packages, versions, severity
2. **Internal exposure** — Artifactory query per affected package, cross-ref version ranges
3. **Report** — vulnerable repos + safe upgrade targets

### 3: DevSecOps Report

**Trigger:** "security report", "security posture"

1. Generate report via DevSecOps tools
2. Highlight critical/high CVEs, applicability status, trends
3. Summarize by severity with actionable next steps

### 4: Artifact Search

**Trigger:** "find artifact X", "what versions are deployed?"

1. AQL query by name/path/repo/type/date/properties
2. Present results with repo, path, metadata
3. Offer vulnerability/curation follow-up

### 5: Project Setup

**Trigger:** "create a JFrog project"

Creation is **additive and irreversible** (no delete).
1. List existing projects
2. Gather: name, key, package types, Xray indexing, repo types
3. Verify no key conflicts
4. Present full plan → **wait for explicit confirmation**
5. Create project, then repos

### 6: Dependency Audit

**Trigger:** "audit dependencies", "what versions of X?"

1. Query Artifactory for all internal versions
2. Cross-ref with Catalog for vulns/licenses
3. Report: versions, locations, licenses, security issues

### 7: Repository Management

**Trigger:** "list repos", "create a repository"

**Listing:** retrieve and present repos.

**Creation** (additive, irreversible):
1. List existing repos → gather requirements (name, pkg type, repo type, Xray)
2. For virtual: validate default deployment repo is in the repo list
3. Present config → **explicit confirmation** → create

## Response Guidelines

- Include severity, affected versions, and upgrade targets for vulnerabilities
- Always include license type in package reports
- Chain tools sequentially without asking user to wait
- State clearly when results are empty or inconclusive — don't speculate
- Use tables for multi-item listings

## Out of Scope

CI/CD builds, user/permission management, Xray policy/watch config, artifact promotion, access tokens. State boundaries clearly if asked.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tools unavailable:** Admin must enable MCP Server (Administration > General > Settings > MCP Server > ON). SaaS only.
- **Unauthorized:** Restart MCP client to re-auth. Verify URL (`https://<team>.jfrog.io/mcp`) and permissions.
- **Empty results:** Verify package name/ecosystem. Check project/repo access. Package may not exist internally.
- **Inconclusive curation:** Not yet evaluated — advise checking later or escalating to security team.
